_________________=GOAL OF THE WORLD=_________________
The Goal of the world is QUANTITY without sacrificing too much QUALITY and PERFORMANCE.
I want a lot of different interesting things so people don't get bored!!
Without sacrificing too much of the PERFORMANCE and QUALITY.
I understand if we go for QUANTITY we have to sacrifice a bit of QUALITY and PERFORMANCE.
But I think it would be a good thing because most other worlds like drinking night, smashed, Drinking Party go for QUALITY and we need to stand out in our own way, which is gonna be QUANTITY.
I want to overflow people with content, lots of it!!



_________________=VIDEOPLAYER=PRIORITY=1_________________
Make sure nobody can change the videoplayer when stage is locked even with playspace mover
Have a way to turn on a queue player for afterparty


_________________=VIP=PRIORITY=2_____________________
Make the VIP section with a lot of different games.
15$ VIP and 25$ VIP : Have a UI at the entrance that let people let in their friends.
20$ VIP : Have a UI that opens the VIP to the public.
I will do a sketch of the layout and call it"VIP AREA"
-----------------Spin The wheel---------------------
10 Different modes:
1.I just wanna talk(Gets people to talk together) / 2.Tipsy(Similar to Drinking Night Disfunctional) / 3.Drunk(Double Drinking Night Disfunctional) / 4.Nightmare(quadruple Drinking Night Disfunctional) / 5. Spicy(Kinky/Horny/Spicy) / 
6. Random(40 different questions like Prompts) /  7. Hard And Spicy Mix(All the previous Prompts together) / 8. Light and Spicy Mix(All prompt without NightMare) / 9. Hard Mix(All prompts without Spicy) / 10. Light Mix( All prompt without Nightmare and Spicy)
If possible I Would like another mode called: "Make your own wheel" where you can select up to 20 prompt from the list we already have on a UI with the different categories so you can easily find the prompt you are looking for.
------------------Card Table----------------------
Have a UI that lets you choose between 1 Deck / 2 Deck / 3 Deck / Infinity / Cards against humanity / UNO
Give the ability on the cards UI to lock the card for the dealer ( when he leaves unlock the cards and also have a thing where if a certain ammount of people votes to unlock the cards it unlocks them )
To do all that I recommend checking out the card system in the World "Smashed"
When its a normal deck have the cards have gravity, if its UNO or Card against humanity remove their gravity.
Have a "Cheers Button" on the UI Where people can press a button to say they like the dealer and thats the amount he gotta drink at the end. Make it resets when the dealer unlock the card but have a "Previous Cheers" so he can still see how many he got after unlocking them.
I will make you a sketch of the UI called "Cards UI VIP SECTION"
